# Wordle_Game
In this game you will have to guess a word in six attempts. If guessed correctly, you will get the meaning, examples, phonetics of the guessed word. 
If you would not be able to guess the word in the given number of attempts, you will be asked to play again.
This game will helps you to improve your thinking skills and enhance your vocab, and analytical skills.
But When it comes to difficulty level CLI based game is better than UI based game. 
In Frontend and Backend based wordle games will make you compelled to use the pen and paper as you will not be able to see the different colours of alphabets and keyboard keys vanishing which are not present in the word.
